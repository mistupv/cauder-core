Buggy file: barber.erl
Fixed file: barber_fixed.erl

-----------------------------------------------------------
Typical session:

$ erl
> c(barber).
{ok,barber}
> barber:main().

Customers: John and Joe

'John' finished

**deadlock**

Expected behaviour:

$ c(barber_fixed).
{ok,barber_fixed}
> barber_fixed:main().

Customers: John and Joe

'John' finished
'Joe' finished
stop

Using the debugger

* First, instrument the buggy code and get a trace:

>>move to the main folder of the tracer (branch: simple_inst)
>>copy the source file (barber.erl) to the examples folder 

$ make load
> tracer:inst(barber,[{dir,"examples"}]).  // creates baber.erl in the current dir
                                           // this is the instrumented version
> tracer:trace("barber:main()",[{log_dir,"barber_results"}]).
> q().

>>the logs can be found in the folder "barber_results"

* Now, let's inspect the buggy execution using CauDEr:

>>move to cauder (branch: replay)

$ ./cauder.sh

>> Load in barber.erl and the logged trace in barber_results
>> (just need to point to the folder "barber_results")
 
* A typical debugging session:

>> Replay process 71 (main) 100 steps
    -->some processes still have a nonempty log, but this is fine
    -->we want to see what happened with joe 
>> Rollback receive of message 1
    -->many actions undone because of causal dependencies
>> Replay 73 (shop) 1 step
    -->we receive new customer joe, as expected
>> Let us now look at process 73 (shop) and its log, and see if everything goes fine:
    --> it should first send "wakeup" to the barber (replay send 4): ok
    --> it should now receive "ready" from the barber (replay receive 2): ok
    --> it should now send a customer (John) to the barber (replay send 6): ok
    --> let us now go forward step by step till the next loop of barber_shop...
        after 9 steps, we see that the next call is barber_shop(_,[John]),
        which is incorrect! (we sent John, but remove Joe from the waiting room)

  * Solution: change the implementation of removeCustomer for a function that
    removes the last element instead of the first one... -> barber_fixed.erl
